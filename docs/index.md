# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

Welcome to the ChatGPT Prompt Engineering guide for Developers! This guide will provide you with an overview of what prompt engineering is, why it's important, and how you can get started using ChatGPT.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the prompts that are used to generate text with AI models like ChatGPT. By carefully crafting prompts, developers can improve the quality and relevance of the generated text.

## Why is Prompt Engineering Important?

Prompt engineering is important because it can significantly improve the performance of AI models like ChatGPT. By providing high-quality prompts that are well-suited to the task at hand, developers can improve the accuracy, fluency, and coherence of the generated text. In addition, well-designed prompts can help reduce bias in AI models and ensure that the generated text is ethical and fair.

## Getting Started with ChatGPT's Prompt Engineering Tools

- Install [Miniconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_23.3.1-0-Windows-x86_64.exe) from https:/.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers (for python)

- After imniconda installation, go to search and run Anaconda Prompt and create virtual environment using following commands

    `conda create -y -n gpt python=3.11.0`

- Activate the conda environment

    `conda activate gpt`
    
- Clone the repository to your local machine. 

    `git clone https://github.com/ashishkrb7/chatgpt.git "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developer"` 

- Go to working directory

    `cd "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developer"`

- Install the required dependencies using 

    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Go to notebook folder

    `cd docs/notebooks`

- Create .env file. It should contain following information

    ```txt
    api_type = 
    api_base = 
    api_version = 
    OPENAI_API_KEY = 
    ```


## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when designing and refining prompts for ChatGPT and other details you will get it in documentation and notebook file:

- **Be Clear and Specific:** Your prompts should clearly communicate the task that you want the AI model to perform. Use specific language and provide as much detail as possible.

- **Avoid Bias:** Be mindful of any potential biases that may be introduced into the generated text. Use inclusive language and consider the potential impact of your prompts on different groups of people.

- **Test and Iterate:** Experiment with different prompts and see how they affect the generated text. Continuously refine your prompts based on feedback and performance metrics.

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is a critical part of building AI applications with models like ChatGPT. By following best practices and using ChatGPT's prompt engineering tools, developers can improve the quality, relevance, and fairness of the generated text.
